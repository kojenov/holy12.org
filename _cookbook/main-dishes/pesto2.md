A delicious, kid friendly, meal. It is best and cheaper to make this at the end of the summer when basil is plentiful at the farmer’s market. We make enough for the whole year…about 20 or so…and freeze them flat in quart size freezer bags. You can get basil year round at Trader Joe’s. Serves 5 with leftovers.

### Ingredients

- 2 packed cups of washed and spun basil leaves
- 1-2 cloves of garlic (personal preference)
- 4 T pine nuts (any kind)
- 1 t salt
- Almost 1 cup olive oil

### Directions

Put all ingredients in blender and puree. You have an amazingly healthy little meal. Toss with 1 and 1/2 lbs. of pasta of your choice. Spaghetti or orzo are good choices. You will have leftovers. Cut the recipe by 2/3 for one lb of pasta. The blender works better than a food processor for this.
