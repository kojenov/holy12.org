Serves 6-8

This recipe is taken from my favorite cookbook, Nourishing Traditions, and is a Friday dinner standby in our house. It’s so rich and delicious, you’d never know it was Lenten!

### Ingredients

- 1 c. red kidney beans
- warm filtered water
- 1 TBS. lemon juice
- 1 can coconut milk (do NOT use “lite”!)
- 1 bunch green onions, chopped
- 1-3 jalapeno peppers (1 is necessary for flavor, but for more heat add two or three)
- 3 cloves garlic, mashed
- 2 tsps. Thyme, dried
- 2 tsps. Sea salt
- 1 tsp. dried green peppercorns
- 1 c. brown rice, soaked for at least 7 hours in warm water.

### Directions

1. The night before, cover beans with the warm water and stir in lemon juice. Leave in a warm place.
1. In the morning, drain and rinse the beans and place in a pot. Add enough water to cover the beans, bring to a boil, and skim.
1. Add remaining ingredients except rice.
1. Cover and simmer for about 6-8 hours or until beans are tender.
1. Drain the rice and add to the pot with enough filtered water to cover the rice and beans about ½ inch.
1. Bring to a boil and cook, uncovered, until liquid has reduced to the level of rice and beans.
1. Cover and cook on lowest heat for about 30 minutes.
