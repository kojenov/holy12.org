Serves 6

### Ingredients

- 1 red bell pepper, cut into long, thin strips
- 1 lb. medium-large (25 count) shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- ½ medium onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 1/3 cup dry white wine
- 3 tbsp freshly squeezed orange juice
- grated zest of 1 orange
- 1/8 – ¼ tsp chili pepper flakes (to taste)
- 12 Kalamata olives, pitted coarsely chopped
- salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 lb fusilli or other pasta, cooked

### Directions

1. Cut each shrimp into 3 pieces and set aside.
1. Over medium-low heat (in pan large enough to hold all ingredients except pasta) sauté onion and pepper in olive oil, stirring frequently until soft, approximately 10 minutes. Add garlic and shrimp and toss in oil until shrimp turns pink, about 2-3 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring frequently, until sauce is slightly reduced, about minutes. Stir in orange juice,zest and chili flakes. Briefly bring sauce back to boil until thick enough to coat pasta (remove shrimp if you need to boil more than a minute, then return to sauce).
1. Toss with pasta.
