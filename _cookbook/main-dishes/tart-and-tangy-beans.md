### Ingredients

- 3 cups dried pinto beans
- 4 cups chopped onions
- 2 Tbs. olive oil
- 11⁄2 to 2 tsp. salt
- 1 Tbs. chili powder
- 2 tsp. cumin
- 11⁄2 tsp. dry mustard
- 6 to 8 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 6 Tbs. dry white wine (optional)
- 6 to 8 Tbs. cider vinegar (to taste)
- 3 to 4 Tbs. Molasses (to taste)
- 2 cups grated mild cheese (optional)
- Lots of black pepper
- Crushed red pepper, to taste
- 3 medium-sized tart apples, cut into medium-sized chunks
- 4 medium-sized ripe tomatoes, chopped

### Directions

1. Place the presoaked beans in a kettle and cover them with plenty of water. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer, partially cover, and cook slowly until tender (1-2 hours), checking the water level during cooking. Drain off any excess when the beans are done. (This can be saved for soup stock.)   You can also use a crock pot very effectively.
1. Begin cooking the onions in olive oil in a medium-sized skillet. Add salt, chili powder, cumin, and mustard, and sauté over medium heat for about 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and sauté for another 5 minutes or so. Add this sauté to the cooked beans, along with all remaining ingredients.
1. Preheat oven on 350°. Mix the beans well and transfer to a deep casserole or a 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Cover tightly with foil, and bake 1 hour
