### Ingredients

- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 T. olive oil
- 1 16 oz. pkg frozen lima beans
- 1 14 oz. can canned tomatoes with their liquid
- salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

Saute onion in oil until browned. Add lima beans (straight from freezer is okay) and tomatoes. Simmer about 15-20 minutes until lima beans are cooked. Serve over Arabic Rice Pilaf. This can also be made with green beans (frozen, canned or fresh)â€”the dish is then called Lubyi bi Roz (Green Beans with Rice). You can add carrots when sauteeing the onion if you like.
