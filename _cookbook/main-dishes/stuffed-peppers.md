Strict-Fast Optional

### Ingredients

- 5 peppers (green, red, orange, yellow – you choose!), cleaned out & cut in half lengthwise
- ¼ c. olive oil (or 1/3 c. veg. broth)
- 1 onion, chopped
- ¼ c. chopped fresh parsley (or 1 TBS dried)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 14 oz. can tomatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 c. uncooked rice
- 1 c. vegetable broth or water
- 1 can cannellini beans (or 1 can corn)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375
1. Arrange halved peppers in bottom of 9x12 baking dish
1. Saute onions in oil, medium heat, until softened, 3-5 min. If using vegetable broth instead, simmer.
1. Add parsley & garlic, continue to cook 2 minutes.
1. Add tomatoes, blend well.
1. Add rice, salt & pepper, mix.
1. Gently add beans or corn and vegetable broth.
1. Spoon into pepper halves. Place extra in the baking dish around the peppers.
1. Pour ½ - 1 c. water over peppers and cook for approximately 1 hour (until rice is done). Cover with aluminum foil and remove it the last 15 minutes (or if your family like it “crunchy”, don’t put any foil on it).

**Note:** this is a great dish to throw in other vegetables, too – eggplant and zucchini are great for stuffing. Tomatoes make a nice addition: After you put the rice mixture in the peppers, slice some tomato wedges and nestle them between the peppers. They will roast while cooking.
