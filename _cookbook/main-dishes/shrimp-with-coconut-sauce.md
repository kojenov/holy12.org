Serves 3-4

#### Sauce

    1 tbsp. tomato paste
    3/4 tsp. salt
    1/4 tsp. sugar
    1 tsp. garam masala (Indian spice blend)
    1/2 tsp. ground cumin
    1/8 - 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
    3 tbsp. finely chopped cilantro
    1 green chili, finely chopped
    1 tbsp. lemon juice
    1 can (7 oz. coconut milk, well stirred)

Put the tomato paste, salt, sugar, spices, and lemon juice in a large bowl with 1 tbsp. water.  Mix well.  Slowly add the coconut milk, mixing as you pour.  Set aside.

#### To stir-fry the shrimp

    3 tbsp. vegetable oil
    1 tsp. black or yellow mustard seeds
    3 cloves garlic, peeled & finely chopped
    1 1/4 lb. med-size shrimp, cleaned, peeled, tail off

Put the oil in a pan over medium heat.  When oil is hot, put in the mustard seeds.  When the seeds begin to pop, add the garlic. Stir until the garlic slightly browns and put in the shrimp.  Stir until the shrimp turn opaque most of the way through. Add the sauce and heat through.  Serve with Basmati-style rice.
