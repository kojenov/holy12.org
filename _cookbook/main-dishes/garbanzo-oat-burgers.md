Makes 6 small-medium sized burgers

### Ingredients

- 2 tsp. oil (coconut oil is a good one for frying)
- 1/2 c. chopped onion
- 2 c. rolled oats
- 1/2 c. ground nuts
- 1 cup canned or cooked garbanzo beans
- 3/4 c. water
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/4 tsp. celery seed (optional)
- 2 leaves sage or 1/4 tsp. dried sage

### Directions

Heat oil in large skillet over med-high heat. When oil is hot, saute onion for 10 min. or so until tender and browned. Place oats and nuts in a large mixing bowl. Mix and set aside. Process remaining ingredients in blender until creamy. Pour mixture into oat and nut mixture. Add cooked onions and mix. The mixture will be fairly stiff. Allow mixture to rest for 5 minutes so oats absorb liquid. Form into 6 thick patties. Brown in a large oiled skillet, slowly, about 5-7 minutes on each side. Serve on hamburger buns if desired.
