The classic Middle Eastern lentil and rice dish.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups dry lentils
- 1 cup rice (I use brown basmati rice)
- 3 onions
- 5-6 T. olive oil (or more, depending on taste)
- Salt and pepper
- Allspice

### Directions

To the lentils, add 8 cups water and some salt. Boil the lentils halfway until done. While the lentils are boiling, chop 2 of the onions and sauté in half of the olive oil, sautéing until a little beyond golden brown. When the onions are almost done, add ½ T. allspice and 1 t. salt and sauté a little more. Set onions aside. When lentils are halfway done, add the rice and boil until the rice is almost done (stir and add water as needed). Turn down the burner to simmer off the last liquid 10-15 minutes and add salt, pepper, and about 1 T. allspice along with the sautéed onions.

Take the last onion and slice it into rings. Sauté it in the remaining olive oil until very brown (almost black). Use the onions rings as a garnish when serving.

Majedra is traditionally served with cabbage salad, but is also good with roasted vegetables.
