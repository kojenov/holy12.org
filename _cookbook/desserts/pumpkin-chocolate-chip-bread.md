---

### Ingredients

- 4 cups sugar
- 1 cup canola oil
- 1 28-oz. Can pumpkin (just pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling with added spices)
- 5 cups flour
- 4 t. soda
- ½ t. clove
- 1 T. cinnamon (one Tablespoon, not one teaspoon)
- 1 T. salt
- 1 12 oz. Pkg semi-sweet chocolate chips (Trader Joe’s brand is great)

### Directions

Mix the sugar, oil, and pumpkin until well combined. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, soda, spices, and salt. Blend the dry ingredients into the sugar/oil/pumpkin mix. Fold in the chocolate chips. Put into 3 to 4 greased and floured bread pans. Bake at 350 degrees for 60 minutes. Note: If you are not fasting and want a fun treat, this bread is great spread with cream cheese frosting!
