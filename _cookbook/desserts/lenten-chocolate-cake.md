### Ingredients

- 3 c. flour
- 2 tsp. baking soda
- 6 TBS. cocoa
- 1 tsp. salt
- 2 c. sugar
- 3 TBS. vinegar
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 3/4 c. veg. oil
- 2 c. water

### Directions

1. Measure flour, soda, cocoa, salt and sugar into large mixing bowl.
1. Add vinegar, vanilla, oil, and water and mix well.
1. Pour batter into greased 9x13 pan.
1. Bake at 350 for 40-45 min.
1. Let cake sit for an hour then sprinkle with powdered sugar on the top OR make choc. icing: mix sugar, cocoa, and a little margarine. Add enough warm water to make a smooth, creamy icing.

**Extra chocolate:** Take big dark chocolate chips from the bulk section and placed them on top before I put it in the oven. I think they slowly sink in and melt into gooey goodness!!! Once I tried dark chips mixed in the batter and they sunk to the bottom when I poured in into the pan so the bottom was choc. chips when we cut into it...not as good. It's just as moist without chocolate chips.
