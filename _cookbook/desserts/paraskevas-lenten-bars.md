### Directions

Mix together:

- 1/2 c. chopped roasted almonds
- 1/4 c. raw pumpkin seeds
- 1/2 c. raw hazelnuts,chopped
- 1/2 c. cup dried cranberries
- 3 cups oats
- 1/4 cup brown rice flour
- 1/4 cup soy protein
- 1/2 cup flax seed meal
- 1/2 cup wheat germ

Melt/Heat in microwave for 90ish seconds:

- 1/4 cup lecithin (this comes in dry and wet form.  The wet is less expensive and seems to make the bars more moist)
- 3/4 cup peanut butter
- 3/4 cup brown rice syrup
- 1/2 cup maple syrup

Mix wet with dry.  Spread in sprayed 9x13 pan. Let stand for 30 min, then cut into bars and wrap. Make sure you freeze what you don't eat. I cut them and wrap individually, then freeze.  They defrost really quickly.  You can buy a lot of these ingredients in the bulk section of the health food section of Fred Meyer. Also, they taste even better the next day!
