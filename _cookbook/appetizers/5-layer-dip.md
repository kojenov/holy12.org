Serves 4-6

This is great for a quick dinner with very little prep time. The ingredients and amounts are a guideline. Add more or less or none – or add your own ingredients. To keep the mouth-watering fresh taste, always use fresh cilantro and resist the fasting-temptation to add soy cheese, tofu, etc. as you don’t need it. This tastes even better as a leftover.

### Ingredients

- 2 cans black beans, drained & rinsed (Trader Joe’s Cajun style black beans work well, too)
- Enchilada sauce – 1 can favorite brand or 1 bottle Trader Joe’s “Red Sauce”
- 2 avocados, sliced (optional: sprinkle with lime juice & salt)
- 1½ c. lettuce, chopped
- 1-2 16 oz. jars salsa
- 1 can sliced black olives
- 1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
- Chips for dipping or tortillas for wrapping

### Directions

1. Heat beans and enchilada sauce in sauce pan, simmer 3-5 minutes. Put in bottom of 8x8 glass container. (The heating and simmering can be skipped if you are in a hurry.)
1. Layer remaining ingredients:
- bean-enchilada mixture (cooled)
- avocado
- lettuce
- salsa
- olives
- fresh chopped cilantro
1. Dip a chip or wrap in a tortilla!
