title: "Shrimp dip"
---

(serve with tortilla chips)

### Ingredients

Just eyeball the ingredients in this one. It is supposed to be like a creamy salad dip.

- 1/2 lb or so bay shrimp, rinsed and drained
- Vegenaise (non-dairy mayo)
- Salsa
- Fresh chopped cilantro
- salt & pepper

### Directions

Mix all together and serve with tortilla chips. This is better if you let the dip set in the fridge for a few hours so flavors can combine, then serve.
