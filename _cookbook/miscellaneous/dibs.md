This has a long simmer time, but is very worth it!

### Ingredients

- 3 T. olive oil
- 1 chopped onion
- 2 med. Carrots, chopped
- 2 sticks celery, chopped
- 3 cloves pressed garlic
- 1-1/2 lbs. mushrooms
- 1 T. olive oil
- 2 boxes mushroom broth (available at Natures or New Seasons)
- 1 c. barley
- 1-2 t. salt

### Directions

Saute onion, carrot, celery and garlic in 3 T. olive oil until carmelized (turning golden brown). Transfer to food process and process until fine. Saute mushrooms in remaining 1 T. olive oil until they release their juices. In a large pot, place processed vegetables, mushrooms, broth, barley and salt (can use Crock Pot). Simmer until barley is tender, about 1 hour. May need to add some water to thin.
