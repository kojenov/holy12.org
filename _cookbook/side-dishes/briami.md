(Roasted Vegetables)

This is a staple Greek dish. The oil really makes the vegetables taste better (my Yiayia used to say ‘vegetables want oil’ and Prevention Magazine affirms that we absorb more nutrients from vegetables with oil).

Serves 5 with delicious leftovers.

### Ingredients

- 2-3 zucchinis
- 4 potatoes (more if red)
- 1/2 lb whole mushrooms
- 2 peeled, sweet potatoes
- 2 onions, sliced
- 1 1/2 cups of baby carrots
- 1/2 lb of fresh or frozen green beans
- 3/4 cup of oil
- 2 cans of tomato sauce (15 oz)
- 1/2 bunch of chopped fresh parsley (or other herbs)
- Salt and freshly ground pepper

### Directions

1. Cut washed veggies up into medium, bite-sized pieces:
1. Spray Pam on a large roasting pan. Add the veggies, the sauce, the salt and pepper and drizzle on the oil. Bake at 375 for 45 minutes, then turn down oven to 350 until tender and slightly browned (up to 30 more minutes).
1. Finish off with a 5 minute broil for added browning. Serve with homemade bread. Serves 5 with leftovers that taste better the next day.
