6 or so large beets (3 red, 3 yellow)

Cut off greens from beets, drizzle with EVOO (extra-virgin olive oil) and wrap them all together in tinfoil.

Bake beets at 400 for at least 1 hour 20 minutes (sometimes they take longer, up to 1 hour & 45 min.).  Take out of the oven when beets are soft as tested by poking with knife.

Peel beets by hand (peel should come off easily)
Chop up the beets into 1/2 inch pieces or so.

Mix chopped beets with 2-3 cloves finely chopped garlic, 3/4 c. or more of Vegenase to desired creaminess (this is a non-dairy mayo - only use this brand!  do not use Nayonase!), and throw in some roasted, salted pecans (as many as you like).  Mix together, add some salt & pepper.

This may sound a bit strange but this is one of the best lenten salads ever!  Its so healthy as well as beets have many vitamins and fiber.
