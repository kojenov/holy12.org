### Ingredients

- 1 cup polenta (coarse-ground cornmeal)
- 4 cups water
- 2 t. olive oil (or to taste)
- salt to taste

### Directions

Bring the water to boil with salt. Slowly add the polenta, turn heat to medium-low and stir constantly for the first minute or so. Turn heat to low and let the polenta simmer about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. When it is thick, add the olive oil.

This is an excellent “base” for lots of Lenten dishes—you can put commercial pasta sauce, leftover soup that has thickened, St. John’s Stew, roasted vegetables, or just about anything on it for a very quick dinner.
