title: "Roasted butternut squash soup"
---

6 servings.

Roasting the squash makes it easier to peel and seed, and deepens the flavor of its flesh, producing a richer, more flavorful soup.

### Ingredients

- 2 large butternut squashes, each 1 1/2 to 2 lb.
- 1/3 cup hazelnuts
- 6 Tbs. (3/4 stick) margarine
- 2 yellow onions, chopped
- 8 fresh sage leaves, shredded
- 6 cups vegetable stock or canned broth
- Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
- Ground nutmeg, to taste, if needed
- Pinch of sugar, if needed

### Directions

1. Preheat an oven to 400°F.
1. Prick each squash with the tip of a knife so it won't explode when it bakes. Place the whole squashes on a baking sheet and roast until they feel somewhat soft to the touch and a knife penetrates the skin easily, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and, when cool enough to handle, cut in half lengthwise and remove and discard the seeds and fibers. Scoop out the pulp into a bowl and set aside.
1. While the squashes are cooling, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast until fragrant and the skins have loosened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and, while still warm, place the nuts in a kitchen towel. Rub the towel vigorously to remove the skins; do not worry if small bits of skin remain. Chop and set aside.
1. In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Add the onions and half of the sage and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the stock and squash pulp, raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for a few minutes to combine the flavors. Remove from the heat.
1. Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender or food processor. Return to a clean saucepan. Alternatively, pass the soup through a food mill placed over the pan. Reheat gently over medium-low heat. Season with salt and pepper. If the squash is starchy rather than sweet, a little nutmeg will help. If the nutmeg doesn't give the proper flavor balance, add a pinch of sugar.
1. Ladle into warmed bowls and garnish with the hazelnuts and the remaining sage. Serve immediately.
