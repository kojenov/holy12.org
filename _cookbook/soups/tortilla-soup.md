### Ingredients

- 1 large onion chopped
- 1 Tbsp cumin
- 1 tsp turmeric (you can omit this if you don't have it)
- 1 Tbsp oil
- 2 14-oz cans vegetable broth, plus 1 cup water
- 2 14-oz cans diced tomatoes (fire-roasted are very good!)
- 1 10-oz bag of frozen corn (I use Trader Joe's fire-roasted corn)
- 1 cup green salsa
- 1 can black beans (I like S&W caribbean recipe...I think TJ's has one, too)
- 1/2 - 3/4 cup rice (the more rice you add, the thicker it will be)
- *corn chips, chopped cilantro, lime wedges

### Directions

1. In 5-6 quart Dutch oven (or very large pot) cook onions, cumin and turmeric in oil (medium heat) about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
1. Add broth and water, tomatoes, corn and salsa. Bring to boil, add rice, reduce heat and simmer until rice is almost done (about 20 minutes).
1. Add beans and cook another 5-10 minutes (the longer you cook this, the more the flavor develops)
1. Serve with chopped cilantro and lime, crumble chips into soup

P.S. This also makes a great non-lenten soup - just add 2 shredded chicken breasts with the broth, etc. and add grated cheese as a garnish
