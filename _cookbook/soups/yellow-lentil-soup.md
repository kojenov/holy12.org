title: "Yellow lentil soup"
---

### Ingredients

- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 T. olive oil
- 2 med. Carrots, chopped
- 2 c. yellow lentils (red when dry)
- ½ c. rice (I like brown basmati best)
- 8-11 c. water
- 2 t. cumin
- salt and pepper to taste

### Ingredients

Saute onion in oil until browned (this is optional—if I’m in a hurry, I just chop the onion and add it to the other ingredients without sauteing in oil). Add remaining ingredients and simmer about 2-3 hours (great in Crock Pot).
