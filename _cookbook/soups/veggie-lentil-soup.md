title: "Veggie lentil soup"

### Ingredients

- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, sliced or chopped
- 2 beets, cooked (see note below)
- 2 T. olive oil
- 1-1/2 cups baby lentils (these are available at New Seasons and are much better-tasting than the standard brown lentil)
- 1 T. dill
- 1 T. basil
- Â½ T. oregano
- salt to taste
- 1 cup frozen chopped spinach

### Directions

Saute onion, carrots, and beets in olive oil until the onion is soft. Add the lentils, spices, and salt. Add about 8 cups water (you may need to add more). Simmer until the lentils are soft (about 1 hour). Add the spinach and heat through.

For the beets: roast beets are very easy and great to keep around during a fast. Wash beets (do not peel), wrap individually in aluminum foil and bake at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes to one hour. Once they have cooled, you can put them in the refrigerator and use them whenever you like. The peel will slip right off when you go to use them.
