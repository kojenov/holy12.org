---

### Ingredients

- 2 tsp safflower oil (I use any)
- 3 Tbsp. chopped ginger
- 6 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 large shallot, chopped (4Tbsp)
- 2 diced carrots
- 2 tsp curry powder
- Coarse salt
- ¾ cup unsweetened coconut milk
- 1 cup red lentils
- 1/3 cup chopped dried cherries (I soak mine in hot water first)
- 3 Tbsp. cilantro stems plus 3 Tbsp. leaves for garnish

### Directions

1. Heat oil over medium heat. Add ginger, garlic, shallot, and carrots, and cook, stirring often for about 7 min. Add curry powder, and cook for 1 min.
1. Add salt, ½ cup coconut milk, 4 cups water, and lentils, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until lentils and carrots are tender, for about 8-10 min. Reserve 2 cups of soup, and puree the rest in a blender. Reheat after blending. Stir in reserved solids.
1. Reserving some for garnish, stir cherries and cilantro stems into soup, and ladle into bowls. Swirl in remaining ¼ cup coconut milk, and garnish with cherries and cilantro leaves.
