title: "Moroccan lentil and rice soup"
---

### Ingredients

- 3/4 c. lentils, washed and soaked overnight in 7 c. water (I usually don't soak mine, they cook really quickly)
- 2 Tbsp. Olive oil
- 1/2 c. (approx. 1 bunch) chopped fresh coriander leaves (cilantro) â€“ the recipe says to add the cilantro at the beginning, but I like it to be more fresh and so add it in at the end.
- 1 tsp. Paprika
- 1/4 c. rice (I usually use brown)
- 2 tsp, salt
- 1/2 tsp. Pepper
- 1/2tsp. cumin
- 1/4 tsp. Chili powder
- 2 Tbsp. Flour, dissolved in 1/2 c. water (if you decrease the amount of water used for cooking, which I do, you don't have to add the flour as a thickener)
- 4 Tbsp. Lemon juice


### Directions

Bring lentils with their water, olive oil and paprika (and rice IF you are using brown rice) to a boil and then cover and cook over medium heat for 25 minutes. Add remaining ingredients except for the flour and lemon juice, then cook for another 20 minutes or until rice turns tender but is still whole. Remove from heat then slowly stir in flour and lemon juice. Bring back to a boil and then transfer to a serving bowl and serve hot.
