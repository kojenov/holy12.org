The Orthodox Faith traces back to the Apostolic times, after Christâ€™s Resurrection. There are approximately 250 million Orthodox Christians worldwide and 1.3 percent of the population in the United States. Eastern Orthodoxy is the largest single religious faith in Belarus, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Cyprus, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Russia and Ukraine.

## What is the Orthodox Church?

The Orthodox Church is the Church founded by Jesus Christ and his Apostles, begun at the day of Pentecost with the descent of the Holy Spirit. It is also known , in the West, as the Eastern Orthodox Church or the Greek Orthodox Church.

The Orthodox Church traces unbroken succession to the Apostles (Apostolic Succession), therefore each bishop ultimately receives their consecration from our Lord Jesus Christ. All the bishops of the Church, no matter their titles, are equal in their sacramental office. At an ecumenical council, each bishop may cast only one vote, whether he is the Ecumenical Patriarch or an auxiliary bishop without a diocese. Thus, there is no equivalent to the Roman Catholic papacy within the Orthodox Church.
