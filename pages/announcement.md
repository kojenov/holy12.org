## COVID-19 update - 10 April 2020

To comply with the State of Washington regulations, all church services and social gatherings at Holy Apostles have been suspended until further notice.

**However**, we are still conducting services that are live-streamed at [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9dbrilNCGAKOQfzaEw9BMg){:target="_blank"}. All are welcome to tune in and join us as we celebrate the services of Holy Week and Pascha. We are also uploading [service materials](/service-materials/) so you could follow the services and sing along.
