Holy Apostles has many ministries designed to serve the needs of our church and community. Some ministries center on our church services, such as our choir, altar servers, chanters and readers. Others center on maintaining our property. Yet others center on fellowship, outreach and serving those in need.  We hope that everyone in the parish finds a place to serve and participate. If you have questions about a particular ministry, want to volunteer or participate, please contact the individual who leads that ministry.

The ministries indicated with an **asterisk (*)** are the ones that could use more volunteers. Please select from these ministries on your ministry sign up form. Thank You!

## Education

### Adult Catechism
This ministry is designed to provide instruction to our catechumens who are preparing to become Orthodox Christians and inquirers who are interested in Orthodoxy. The classes cover many topics: historical, theological, life practice and tradition… The classes meet on Wednesday evenings at 6pm following vespers and are led by Fr. Michael.
 
### *Youth Group
Teens and youth leaders meet together for additional fellowship opportunities and activities that are aimed at deepening their faith and enriching their bonds and experiences as young Orthodox Christians. We are currently seeking volunteers to serve as youth leaders. Volunteers should be unrelated adults (1 male and 1 female) who are members in good standing. Leaders will go on youth outings as a supervisory adults and provide a variety of activities for youth. 
 
### *Sunday School
During the school year, each Sunday after the fellowship meal, our children go to Sunday School classes, with a break during the summer months. Volunteers serve as Sunday School Director, teachers, and classroom assistants. Dn. Alex Ivkin is our current Sunday School Director and we can always use more assistance with teaching our youth!

 
## Administration

### *Newsletter
Every month Holy Apostles distributes our newsletter. Volunteers serve as editor or assist the editor with creating and publishing the parish newsletter. Tasks involved in creating the newsletter include news gathering, layout, graphic design, writing faith related articles, book reviews, movie reviews, recipe sharing, photography and art submissions, and more. Our current editor is Tazsa Wells and she is always happy to receive and publish submissions from the parish community and beyond. Please consider contributing a monthly column in the newsletter!
 
### Fundraising
Occasionally Holy Apostles holds various events and drives to raise funds for special projects. Volunteers engage in event planning, event management and activities, food preparation and service, seek event underwriting and sponsors and other fundraising activities.
 
### Parish Council
Holy Apostles business is managed by an elected group of leaders who become members of the Parish Council for fixed terms. To serve on the Parish Council, one must be approved by the parish priest for nomination, and be placed on the ballot by the sitting Parish Council. The ballot is presented at the annual parish business meeting, and those with the highest number of votes are elected.
 
## Liturgical

Please note: Ministries that involve the Liturgy and church services may require pastoral approval and training. Examples include altar servers, readers, adult choir members, and chanters.
 
### Altar Server/Acolyte
During Liturgy a group of men and boys serve the needs of the Altar under the direction of the clergy. Volunteers are willing to undergo training and to be scheduled to serve during services throughout the year. Leonid Kovalenko is the leader of this ministry and the priest must grant his blessing for new altar servers to begin serving.
 
### Chanter
During services it is our tradition to chant – musically intone – liturgical hymnody. Volunteers are willing to learn prescribed chanting tradition and convention, and to be scheduled to chant at church services throughout the year. 
 
### Reader
During church services, appointed scriptures and other texts are read by a Reader according to the Liturgical calendar under the direction of the clergy. A Reader is a man of good character who has been accepted into the minor clerical order through tonsure by a diocesan bishop, setting him to read in services, including the Divine Liturgy. If a man is interested in this ministry, he must seek approval from his priest to begin preparation and study for the office. 
 
### Choir
During Liturgy, weddings and funerals, the adult choir members sing hymnody under the direction of the choir director. Those seeking to sing in the choir must sing music and learn basic hymnody used frequently in the choir. They also must be willing to participate in choir rehearsals, continuously learn choir music and participate in church services as a choir member. Please contact our choir director, Nika Cable to learn more.
 
### *Prosphora Baker
Prosphora, a special bread used for communion, is required at each Liturgy. Volunteers make sure prosphora is provided for liturgy without fail. Volunteers prayerfully bake the prosphora and make sure it is delivered in a timely manner before Liturgy. Training is needed to properly and prayerfully bake the prosphora. Fr. Michael and Vera Ayzina coordinate with other prosphora bakers to produce these gifts for our holy services. 
 
### *Flowers
On various days throughout the year we decorate icons and the temple with flowers – most memorable are days like Palm Sunday and Pascha. Other days it may just be a vase of flowers and a garland draped over an icon. Volunteers are scheduled to assist in acquiring and arranging flowers for major feasts and other times flowers are needed during church services. Diana Didyk and Olga Ivkin are the leaders of this ministry and they could use some assistance.
 
## Building and grounds
 
### *Building Improvement
The Holy Apostles Church building and grounds are in need of ongoing upkeep. Volunteers help with regular preventative maintenance, as well as repairs and improvements - plumbing, electrical, roofing, painting and exterior/internal repairs. In addition, there are always janitorial needs. Contact Dn. Alexei Kojenov if you are able and willing to help with building improvements.
 
### Sunday Stewardship Teams
Formerly known as clean-up teams, the Sunday Stewardship Teams will work best with full participation by all regularly attending, able bodied parishioners who are not otherwise engaged in another ministry during the time of volunteer service. Sunday Stewardship Team members will be responsible for playground supervision and cleanup after the fellowship meal. There are four Sunday Stewardship Teams and each team will have a Team Leader. The Team Leader will ensure that all tasks and roles are fulfilled for the assigned Sunday. Each Sunday Stewardship Team will have a backup team; this will be the team assigned two weeks away (for example, the backup for first Sunday's Stewardship Team will be the one assigned to the Third Sunday). This will work well if people continue to notify the group when they are going to be absent ahead of time allowing a volunteer to step up and it will also work when there is no advance notification because the members of the backup team will be aware that it's their backup day and will be prepared to fill in.
 
### *Coffee and the Grounds
Our property is enhanced with beautiful flowers, shrubs and trees. A great deal of work is needed on an ongoing basis to maintain the beauty of our grounds. Volunteer opportunities include: pruning, weeding, watering, mulching, grass cutting, picking up garbage and debris, minor repairs to fencing, equipment, and garden beds in addition to planting flowers and bulbs. Sophia Burkett is the leader for this ministry and she is seeking 3 more volunteers for the meetings that take place on first and third Sundays.
 
## Fellowship and outreach

### Charitable Works

#### Grab 'N' Go Bags For Homeless
Holy Apostles volunteers prepare care packages for the homeless by collecting useful items and assembling them into gallon sized zipper bags to pass out to the needy.

#### Adopt a Family via Open House Ministries
Sponsor a family through the holidays by gifting items listed on their wish list. 

#### Orthodox Christians for Life
Volunteers organize Orthodox Christians to participate in memorials and walks for life, attend pro-life events, assist pro-life organizations, and participate in fundraising efforts for birth centers like Options 360's Baby Bottle Drive. We also engage in 40 Days for life prayer challenges and other prayerful movements to raise awareness about the sanctity of life.

 
### *Hospitality
Members of the Holy Apostles hospitality team are the ones who procure provisions for the church including coffees, teas, milks, cleaning supplies, paper goods, and other items needed for fellowship meals and special occasions or events. They are also the ones who put the coffee and hot water on in the mornings before liturgy and set out the dishes and utensils for the meals. They also assist the hospitality teams of other churches in combined church gatherings. The hospitality team leaders are Elena Kojenova and Silouani Perez. It would be good for more people to sign up to this ministry.
 
 
### *Visitation
Volunteers for this ministry visit people who are sick or shut-ins. Currently visitation is informal in the parish, but we seek a leader who would organize and lead this ministry, and organize not only visits, but supportive services for those needing transportation to appointments, help getting groceries or other needs they are unable to perform. 
 
### *Visitor Welcoming
Volunteers greet newcomers and make them feel welcome at Holy Apostles. They offer literature on Orthodoxy, and encourage visitors to stay for the fellowship meal and sit and visit with them and introduce them to others. This ministry has been informal but we hope it will become more organized under the leadership of a volunteer. 
 
### *Meals for the Sick & New Mothers
We have a Coordinator who works to make sure that those who are sick or are new mothers are provided meals while they are recovering. Volunteers work with the Coordinator to cook meals and arrange for delivery. Emmelia Beckel is the leader of this ministry and it would be nice for her to have more assistance.
 
### *Bookstore
The Holy Apostles bookstore will offer books and other Orthodox items as an outreach ministry. Volunteers will assist customers after Liturgy each Sunday morning, when the store is open. The store will be located in the Cry Room. Please contact parish council for more info on volunteering.   

### *Lending Library
The Holy Apostles Lending Library is on the 2nd story split between the central class area and the first classroom at the top of the stairs. Our Church Library is a wonderful resource for those wishing to learn more about our Orthodox Christian Faith. Its collection also includes many classical and contemporary books. In addition we also have digital resources such as dvds and cds. We need a few volunteers to help get the library organized and to maintain the borrowing records. 
 
### Sisterhood
We welcome volunteers who have the desire to get this ministry going to organize women's activities for deepening their faith and enriching their lives as Orthodox Christian women. 
 
### Brotherhood
We welcome volunteers who have the desire to get this ministry going to organize men's activities for deepening their faith and enriching their lives as Orthodox Christian men.
 
### Information Technology
The parish has a website and a Facebook page, uses electronic mailing lists for intra-parish communication, an online calendar for scheduling, and other online and offline tools, such as the internet connection, printer/copier and desktop computer at the church. Volunteers support active online presence by posting Facebook updates, maintaining the website and other informational assets. Some activities do not require any specialized knowledge or training. Contact Dn. Alexei Kojenov if you are willing to learn more or can provide IT assistance.
