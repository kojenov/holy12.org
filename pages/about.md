We are an [Orthodox Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_christian) parish that belongs to [Diocese of the West](https://www.dowoca.org/) of the [Orthodox Church in America](http://www.oca.org/).

Currently, Holy Apostles Orthodox Christian Mission is the only Eastern Orthodox Christian Church serving Southwest Washington with a growing congregation made up of families from all across the Vancouver-Portland Metro Area.

Our congregation is multicultural and multi-lingual, and this is reflected in our worship which integrates a small amount of Church Slavonic and Russian into our predominantly English services.

Our address is: [3214 N St, Vancouver, WA 98663](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=3214+N+St,+Vancouver,+WA+98663&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=61.540818,76.113281&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=3214+N+St,+Vancouver,+Clark,+Washington+98663&amp;z=17)
